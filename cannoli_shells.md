# Cannoli Shells

These guys are a down right BITCH to make, although, so worth the effort.
Be prepared for a good 3-4 hours of work here.
Also, best to have a kitchen hand around, since there's times where more than one person will help increase the quality.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup all-purpose flour plus additional for dusting
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
* 500g cold lard
* 4 tablespoons Marsala wine
* 1 large egg, separated
* 1l vegetable oil

## Method

1. In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, cinnamon, salt and soda
2. Take a quarter of the lard and, using your hands, mix with the dry mixture until all the lard has been worked in
3. Add the Marsala and egg yolk, and combine until a dough forms
4. On a flour dusted surface, kneed until the dough is soft and elastic. If the mixture is dry, add more Masala. The dough should resemble Play-doh
5. Form into a disc and wrap tightly in plastic-wrap and let sit for an hour (probably a good time to make the filling)
6. Cut the dough into quarters, we're going to process one quarter at a time and be sure to keep the other sections cling-wrapped.
7. Using a pasta machine, start rolling the dough from the thickest setting to the thinnest
8. On a flour-dusted board, cut the dough into circles
9. Once cut, very lightly dust with flour and place onto baking paper, repeat with all the dough
10. In a large pot, get the oil and the remaining lard heated to ~180ยบ
11. Whisk the egg white and brush onto one side of the dough
12. Lightly oil the cannoli tubes and wrap the dough
13. Drop the tube into the deep fry and cook for 30 seconds
14. Remove from the fry and place on paper towels
15. Once cool, slide off the tube and set aside
16. Profit
