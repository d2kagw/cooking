# Zabaglione

Need a lift?
BAM!

My Nonna used to give this to us as kids when we had the flu/cold.
We'd be bouncing off the walls in no time :)

(serves one)

## Ingredients

* 1 egg yolk
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon of Marsalla
* 1/2 tablespoon of Espresso coffee

## Method

1. Place the Egg and Sugar in a small glass
2. Using a whisk, fork or spoon, mix like crazy until the a light and fluffy cream has formed
3. Add the Marsalla or Espresso stir and serve...

## Notes
* When confirming this recipe online some people actually mentioned to use champagne instead of Marsalla or Coffee. The result is a light & fluffy cream to be served with Savoiardi 
* When Nonna used to make this for us as kids, I remember it being a hot beverage, so she must have used Espresso Coffee for us, or heat it up in the microwave
