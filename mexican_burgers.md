# Mexican Burger Patties

These patties have a real bite, and go devilishly well with guacamole, salsa, cheese, lettuce and a few jalapenos.

The recipe will make two decent sized patties, about 10cm in diameter and 1.5cm high.

Be sure to add extra spice if you're a chilli lover :D

## Ingredients

* 2 cans of beans (Kidney beans if Black Beans can't be found)
* 3 tablespoons mayo
* 1/3 cup breadcrumbs
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne (hot)
* 1/4 cup finely chopped coriander

## Method

1. strain and dry the beans
2. put the mayo, 1/2 the beans, bread crumbs, cumin, oregano and cayenne in a blender, pulse until a chunky paste has formed
3. using your hands, mix in the coriander and remaining beans
4. shape into patties
5. pan fry until golden on both sides
