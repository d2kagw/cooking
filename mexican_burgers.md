# Mexican Burger Patties

These patties have a bite, and go really well with avocado, salsa and sour cream.

The recipe will make four small patties - each one big enough to go into a sandwich.
I'd recommend doubling it if you're making burgers.

## Ingredients

* 2 cans of beans (Kidney beans if Black Beans can't be found)
* 3 tablespoons mayo
* 1/3 cup breadcrumbs
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne (hot)
* 1/4 cup finely chopped coriander

## Method

1. strain and dry the beans
2. put the mayo, 1/2 the beans, bread crumbs, cumin, oregano and cayenne in a blender, pulse until a chunkly paste has formed
3. using your hands, mix in the coriander and remaining beans
4. shape into patties
5. pan fry until golden on both sides
