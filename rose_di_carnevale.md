# Rose Di Carnevale

Super simple to throw together but can be quite time consuming, so be ready for a full day of cooking.

Will make about 12

## Ingredients

* 150g flower
* 2 eggs separated
* 30g melted butter
* 1 tbs castor sugar
* 4 tbs Marsalla
* pinch of salt
* oil for frying
* 1 cup Pasticcera
* Red Glac√© Cherries

## Method

1. Sift together the flour, sugar and salt
2. Using your hands, work in the egg yolks, butter and marsala to form a dough
3. If sticky add more flour, if too dry add more marsala
4. Roll into a ball and wrap, letting it rest for 30 minutes
5. Dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the dough so it's 3-5mm thick
6. Using a 5cm (or so) round cookie cutter, cut as many circles as possible
7. Cut 4-6 wedges out of them (leaving 'petals' behind)
8. Quickly collect the remaining dough, roll out and repeat until all consumed
9. using a little bit of egg white, join two or three layers together in the middle only, pressing together in the middle
10. Heat your oil
11. One by one, drop the dough into the oil. Use a wooden spoon to press down in the middle - the dough should raise around the edges giving the impression of a flower
12. Allow to cool before dusting with icing sugar
13. Pipe Pasticcera into the middle of the flower and top with a cherry
