# Fritole

Nonna's age-old recipe.
This stuff is 100% delicious.

Although the batter is easy to make, be prepared to be standing over a deep fry for the next few hours.

**Note: The batter will last a day in the fridge, but the Fritole are best eaten on the day their cooked. They're not so bad the day after, but they start to become rubbery and tough if not stored correctly.**

## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 2 cups milk (I use Bonsoy)
* 1 pack vanilla powder (Not easy to find, but it's important you use it and not just replace it with Vanilla Extract - this stuff makes any cake 'taste' Italian. Honest.)
* 2 1/2 cups caster sugar
* 1 orange zest removed and juiced
* 1 lemon zest removed and juiced
* 500g of sultanas (could also use mixed fruits)
* pinch of salt
* 900g self raising flour (have extra on hand to thicken, if the batter is too runny)
* 1/2 cup Marsala or Rum (the more the merrier)
* 2 Apples, peeled and grated

## Method

1. Soak the sultanas and apple in the Marsala for as long as you can bear
2. Throw the eggs, milk, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, vanilla powder, orange and lemon juice & zest into a bowl and mix until combined
3. Sift the flour and salt into the bowl and mix until combined
4. Fold in the sultanas, Marsala and apple
5. The mixture should have the consistency of toothpaste, thick enough to scoop and mould with a spoon, but runny enough that it's not thick and sticky - add more flour or Marsala to even out the mixture

Now, you're ready to fry.

Setup your deep fryer and your workflow - it's important you get it set up well so not to make a giant mess.

You'll need:

  * a large tray with tissue paper to soak up excess oil
  * a scoop to pick out the Fritole once they're cooked
  * some teaspoons to form , or even better, a piping set - it really helps when trying to make evenly sized fritole
  * Caster sugar on hand to ice the babies when they're removed from the fry oil

Depending on the size of your deep fry you may be able to do many Fritole at a time.

One by one, scoop some batter (you only want about a teaspoon worth per Fritole) and drop it in the fry oil. Allow to cook for a moment and turn it using a spoon so it's evenly cooked.

Remove from the heat and put into the tray.

Regularly sprinkle over with sugar.

Each fritole should be a deep brown, but not burnt, and should be well cooked in the middle, not soggy or dough like - think of a Doughnut!

These guys are brilliant while they're still hot, so don't be surprised if most of them are eaten by the time you're done cooking :D
