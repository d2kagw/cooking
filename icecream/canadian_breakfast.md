# Canadian Breakfast Ice Cream

That's right fellas, this bad boy ice cream contains BACON!
Actually, to be accurate, it contains Pancakes, Bacon AND Maple Syrup.

Sounds weird, tastes awesome (although the recipe still needs some work) and surely going to confuse the socks off you.

It's a fairly easy recipe to throw together, but it does take some time.
The hardest thing about making this ice cream is to decide when to eat it - is it a breakfast dish? or a dessert?
Blowing. My. Mind.

Note: the ice cream freezes rock hard, but when it's softened, it has a really amazing texture, so let it sit out of the freezer for 10mins or so to soften before scooping.

## Ingredients (makes a little over 1L)

* 500ml soy milk (I use Bonsoy, you should be able to replace with full cream milk)
* 500ml thickened cream
* 3/4 cup castor sugar
* 1-2 plain pancakes - diced (my advice, have pancakes and bacon for breakfast, and keep a few aside for cooking)
* 4 rashers of bacon
* 2tbs arrowroot
* 2tbs maple syrup
* 1/4tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/8tsp (just a dash) ground nutmeg
* 1/4 of a vanilla bean, seeds scraped

## Method

1. Cook the bacon and pancakes. Two things to remember:
  * IMHO, nothing cooks pancakes better than bacon fat, so cook your bacon first and use the fat left over for the pancakes
  * You want to cook the bacon so it's almost crispy. So it's still a little chewy, but not brittle
2. Mix the arrowroot with 1/4 a cup of milk, stir and put aside for later
3. Dice 1/2 the bacon and place in a bowl with 1tbs of maple syrup, set aside for later
4. In a pot place the rest of the milk, the cream, the rest of the bacon, the rest of the maple syrup, the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla bean seeds and pod
5. Bring to the boil then reduce heat quickly to a simmer - stir frequently for 30 mins
6. Strain the cream mixture (removing the vanilla bean pod and bacon bits) and add sugar, again bring to the boil
7. Once boiled, take off the heat and quickly mix in the arrowroot mixture, stir as the mixture thickens just slightly
8. Transfer to a bowl and throw in a fridge to chill
9. Once chilled, toss the mixture, the bacon bits (the stuff soaking in the syrup) and the pancakes into your ice cream machine
10. 'Process' the batter and ENJOY!!!!
