# Chocolate & Berry Gelato

**Warning:** this ice cream is devine. Be sure you don't eat the chilled batter! I couldn't stop myself!

**Note:** if you added an extra table spoon of cornflower, you'd have a nice chilled pudding.

## Ingredients

* 3 cups full cream milk (or high quality Soy milk)
* 3/4 cup caster sugar
* 2 1/2 tablespoons cornflower
* 3/4 cup good-quality cocoa
* 1 tablespoon blueberry jam
* 4 tablespoons raspberry sauce
* 2 tablespoons Vodka

## Method

1. Place 1 cup of milk, the caster sugar, corn flower and cocoa into a bowl
2. Mix with a electric mixer on high until combined
3. Put remaining milk on the stove until just boiling
4. Mix hot milk into chocolate mixture along with the blueberry jam, 2 tablespoons of raspberry sauce and the Vodka
5. Mix on high until combined
6. Put mixture on low heat until thickened (stir constantly, the mixture will get really thick down the bottom)
7. Chill the mixture in the fridge for several hours
8. Process in the ice cream machine until thick
9. When transferring to a serving/storage container, gently fold in the remaining raspberry sauce. (should result in a 'streak' of sauce)
