# Eggless Vanilla Ice Creamm

I've been on the look out for a good vanilla ice cream recipe for ages.


## Ingredients (makes a little over 1L)

* 500ml soy milk (I use Bonsoy, you should be able to replace with full cream milk)
* 500ml thickened cream
* 3/4 cup castor sugar
* 2tbs arrowroot
* 1/8tsp (just a dash) ground nutmeg
* 1/4 of a vanilla bean, seeds scraped

## Method

1. Mix the arrowroot with 1/4 a cup of milk, stir
2. In a pot place the rest of the milk, the cream, nutmeg and vanilla bean seeds and pod
3. Bring to the boil then reduce heat quickly to a simmer - stir frequently for 30 mins
4. Strain the cream mixture (removing the vanilla bean pod) and add sugar, again bring to the boil
5. Once boiled, take off the heat and quickly mix in the arrowroot mixture, stir as the mixture thickens just slightly
6. Transfer to a bowl and throw in a fridge to chill
7. 'Process' the batter and ENJOY!!!!
