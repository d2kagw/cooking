# Coffee Ice Cream

Need a kick!?
This thing has some serious balls.
(I think it's the best ice cream I've made so far too)

## Ingredients (makes a little over 1L)

* 500ml soy milk (I use Bonsoy, you should be able to replace with full cream milk)
* 500ml thickened cream
* 1 1/2 cup Coffee Beans
* 3/4 cup castor sugar
* 2tbs arrowroot
* 1tbs Vanilla Sugar
* 1/4 tbs Ground Coffee Beans

## Method

1. In a pot place the rest of the milk, the cream, vanilla sugar and coffee beans
2. Bring to the boil then reduce heat quickly to a simmer - stir frequently for 30 mins
3. Let sit for an hour
4. Mix the arrowroot with 1/4 a cup of milk, stir
5. Strain the cream mixture (removing the coffee beans - make sure you get ALL the juices out) and add sugar and the ground coffee, bring to the boil
6. Once boiled, take off the heat and quickly mix in the arrowroot mixture, stir as the mixture thickens just slightly
6. Transfer to a bowl and throw in a fridge to chill
7. 'Process' the batter and ENJOY!!!!
