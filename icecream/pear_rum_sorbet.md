# Spiced Rum & Pear Sorbet

My BFF @brianna was bragging about a Pear Ice Cream she was eating in Japan (where it's currently +30ยบ degrees).
Not being in the mood for something summery (although loving the idea of a Pear flavoured dessert), I threw this simple spicy affair together.

Feel free to adjust the measurements to make it spicier, or *cough* more alcoholic :D

## Ingredients (makes a little over 1L)

* 1 1/4 cup castor sugar
* 3/4 cup water
* 4 pears
* 1/2 Lemon, squeezed
* 1/4 cup of raisins
* 3 dashes of cinnamon
* 2 dash of nutmeg
* 1 dash of white pepper
* 1 shot of brown rum (I used Captain Morgans because that's what I had cupboard, but any rum would do well)

## Method

1. Toss the sugar, water and raisins into a pot, and heat until all the sugar is dissolved
2. Peel and core the pears, cut into pieces
3. Put the sugar water, pears and the rest of the ingredients into a blender, and pulse until liquified
4. Add any additional spices/rums to bring the flavour to your liking (remember that the flavours will be more subtle when you freeze the mixture, but the sweetness will remain)
5. Chill the mixture in the fridge then process in your ice cream machine
