A.K.A Coconut/rosewater/citrus sorbet with chunky bits

## Ingredients
* 3/4 cups caster sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 1/2 cups coconut milk
* 1/2 cup extra water
* 2 tablespoons lime juice
* 1 tablespoons lemon juice
* 3 tablespoons rosewater
* 200g glazed cherries (multi-coloured)
* 1 cup unsalted pistachios

## Method
1. Mix sugar and water over low heat until dissolved
2. Boil for a minute then let cool
3. Add coconut milk, extra water, lime & lemon juice and the rosewater
4. Chill the mixture in the fridge for several hours
5. Process the chilled liquid in the ice cream machine until thick
6. Finely dice the cherries, put aside
7. Shell the pistachios and crush them so each chunk is about 1/4 the size of the original nut (you want it chunky, but not too chunky)
8. In the last 5 mins of processing, add the cherries and pistachios
9. Transfer into a container and pop it in the freezer
10. About 1-2 hours later, grab the sorbet out of the freezer and give it a good stir, just to make sure the chunky bits are evenly distributed.
