# Cherry Ripe Cassata

This dessert is as delicious as it is time consuming - so know that it's worth the effort.
I threw together the recipe for a friends BBQ, where almost everyone attending are devout vegans, so you won't find any dairy, egg or animal based products in this recipe.

There's 4 layers in this Cassata:
1. Shortbread (the base)
2. Rich Chocolate Gelato
3. Cherry paste/mince/stuff
4. Coconut Sorbet

You should really leave yourself 4-5 days to make it - although, you could throw it together in two days if you're in a hurry (given that there's only two ice cream layers, the other two are)

*Note: you'll have left-overs at each layer depending on the size of your tin, so be prepared for some snacking along the way*

## Ingredients

### Shortbread Base
* 1 cup vegan margarine
* 1 cup caster sugar
* 1 cup corn flour
* 2 cups plain flour

### Chocolate Gelato
* 3 cups high quality Soy milk (like Bonsoy)
* 3/4 cup caster sugar
* 2 1/2 tablespoons cornflower
* 3/4 cup good-quality cocoa
* 2 tablespoons Vodka

### Cherry paste/mince/stuff
* 400g Red Glazed Cherries - **Make sure they don't use food colouring 120 (that contains animal byproduct)**
* 1/2 cup Almond Meal
* 1/3 cup Caster Sugar
* few drops of red food colouring - **Make it isn't food colouring 120 (it contains animal byproduct)**

### Coconut Sorbet
* 3/4 cups caster sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 1/2 cups coconut milk
* 1/2 cup extra water
* 2 tablespoons lime juice

## Method

### Shortbread Base
1. Cream the sugar and margarine with a blender on high
2. Sift in the flours
3. Kneed with your hands - adding more flour if tacky
4. Lightly flour a loaf tin
5. Place the dough in the base of the tin, lay out flat so there's a 1cm layer along the entire base (any left overs can be used for tasty cookies which you can eat straight away)
4. Bake at 150&deg; for 25-30 minutes (until golden, but not brown)
5. Allow to cool, and pop in the fridge until we're ready to make the next layer

### Chocolate Gelato
1. Place 1 cup of milk, the caster sugar, corn flower and cocoa into a bowl
2. Mix with a electric mixer on high until combined
3. Put remaining milk on the stove until just boiling
4. Mix hot milk into chocolate mixture along with the Vodka
5. Mix on high until combined
6. Put mixture on low heat until thickened (stir constantly, the mixture will get really thick down the bottom)
7. Chill the mixture in the fridge for several hours
8. Process in the ice cream machine until thick
9. Pour over the top of the shortbread base, so there's about a 1cm thick layer (you can adjust the thickness of each layer to suit your tastes and the hight of your pan)
10. GladWrap it well and pop it in the freezer

### Cherry Paste
1. Dice the cherries - you want to cut them as fine as you possibly can
2. In a large bowl (this will get messy) combine the cherries, food colouring, caster sugar and half of the almond meal
3. Using an electric beater, blend on high speed until well combined
4. The beater will help crush the cherries, you want to do this until the consistency is a thick paste without too many chunks
5. As you go along, add more of the almond meal, this will help thicken it up
6. Pour over the top of the Chocolate Gelato, so there's about a 1cm thick layer (you can adjust the thickness of each layer to suit your tastes and the hight of your pan)
7. Glad Wrap it well and pop it in the freezer

### Coconut Sorbet
1. Mix sugar and water over low heat until dissolved
2. Boil for a minute then let cool
3. Add coconut milk, water, lime juice
4. Chill the mixture in the fridge for several hours
5. Process in the ice cream machine until thick
6. Pour mixture over the Cassata, you want this to be the tallest layer of them all
7. Glad Wrap it well and pop it in the freezer

Once all complete, cut it up with a warm butter knife and serve with a few Mint leaves.
