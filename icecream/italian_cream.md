# Italian Cream Ice Cream

Ever had my famous Tiramisu?
Well this ice cream is inspired by the cream used to layer the delicious dessert.

It's deliciously Italian, and goes great wit a Panatone!!

## Ingredients (makes a little over 1L)

* 500ml soy milk (I use Bonsoy, you should be able to replace with full cream milk)
* 500ml thickened cream
* 2 eggs (yolks only)
* 1 cup castor sugar
* 1tbs arrowroot
* 1tbs Vanilla Sugar
* 2tbs Marsalla

## Method

1. Place the egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar and 1tbs Marsalla in a bowl, mix with a electric mixer until white and creamy
2. Put the milk, thickened cream, 1tbs marsalla and vanilla sugar in a pot and bring to the boil
3. Once boiling reduce heat and simmer for 15mins, stirring frequently
4. Mix arrowroot with a splash of the milk and set aside
5. Add sugar and the rest of the Marsalla (add more if you're game) to the pot and bring to the boil once more
6. Once boiling take off the heat and quickly mix in the arrowroot mixture - stir as it thickens
7. Chill mixture before putting in your ice cream machine
