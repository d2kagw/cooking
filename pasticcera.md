# Pasticcera

As in, Italian Custard.

This stuff is to die for.
Not really something to eat on it's own, but use it as a Cake Filling, with Cannoli, etc, etc.
So tasty.

Doesn't take long to make, but you really need to give it 100% of your attention, if it gets even slightly lumpy it's ruined.

Will last a few days in the fridge.

## Ingredients

* 1ltr milk (I use Bonsoy)
* 4 whole eggs
* 250g caster sugar
* 150g flour
* 3 tsps vanilla essence
* 2 tsps lemon essence

## Method

1. Beat the eggs, sugar, vanilla and lemon until creamy and pale
2. Slowly sift in the flour while mixing; making sure there’s no lumps
3. Beat well
4. Put the milk on the stove, heat until it reaches boiling point (but don’t let it boil)
5. Slowly pour the milk into the egg and sugar mixture, beating constantly
6. Put mixture back on a VERY low heat and stir constantly as it thickens (make sure you really scrape the sides and base of the pot, as this stuff sticks)
7. Take off the heat when the mixture is thick
8. Chill for about 3 hours before using
