# Slow cooked Lamb & Gnocchi

Got a whole day to prepare a meal?
Then this baby is the one.

Note: this is a fair bit of effort, but worth the hours - also, VERY winterly

(serves 4)

## Ingredients

* 4x Frenched Lamb Shanks
* 6x Carrots
* 1x Leek
* 2 cups Guinness
* 1x Tub Tomato Paste
* 2 cups Beef Stock
* 1x Tablespoon Crushed Garlic
* 500g Desiree Potatoes
* 180g '00' Flour + extra for dusting
* Bunch of Kale or Spinach

## Method

1. Dice all the carrots and finely slice the leek
2. season the Lamb with salt and pepper and brown in a hot pan with some oil
3. Put the lamb in a slow cooker and put 1/3 of the carrots, garlic and all of the leek into the fry pan, cook until the carrots start to soften
4. Add in the tomato paste and stir until fragrant, then add in the Guinness and stock - bring to the boil
5. Pour all of the mixture over the lamb shanks and bring back to the boil
6. Lower the heat to an absolute minimum (should be *just* bubbling). Put the lid on and keep an eye on the pot for the next 6-8 hours.
    *  Skim the pot occasionally to remove excess fats and oils
7. Put the potatoes into a pot of water and boil until soft
8. Remove the skin and rice (or loosely mash) the potatoes - don't puree though!, you want rough but soft chunks of potato
9. Scatter the potato out over a towel and allow to cool fully
10. Create a pile with the potatoes and add in the flour - use your hands to form into a firm dough. If it's too sticky then add some flour, if it's too dry carefully add some milk.
11. Bring a pot of water and some rock salt to the boil
12. Separate the dough into a few chunks and roll into logs ~1cm in diameter. Use a knife to cut the Gnocchi into segments
13. Put a fry pan on heat with a small amount of oil and add the remaining carrots, stirring frequently (do this while cooking Gnocchi)
13. Cook the gnocchi in batches so the pot isn't too crowded - when the gnocchi rises to the top, allow to cook for another minute before removing
14. Place the gnocchi onto the fry pan and toss occasional
15. Roughly chop the Kale and place into the frying pan with a cup of the juices from the slow-cooker
16. Stir through so the liquid reduces and the Kale becomes very soft 
17. Serve with some extra sauce and a small grate of strong Parmesan cheese
