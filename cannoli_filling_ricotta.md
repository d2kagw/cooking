# Ricotta Cannoli Filling

Although this is intended as a filling for Cannoli shells, it goes AMAZINGLY well with raisin toast.
So delicious.

* 100g Unsalted Pistachios
* 3 Mandarins (juiced & zest removed)
* 1 cup Caster Sugar

* 1 tablespoon Marsala

## Method

1. Grind the pistachios so they're chunky
2. Blend the pistachios, cheese, mandarin juice & zest, sugar and booze together
3. Add more alcohol to taste (you can never have enough)
4. Eat!
